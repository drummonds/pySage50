Python Sage 50 tools

This is a collection of tools that I have used for helping my day to day work with Sage 50.  The
first group is a collection of tools to make it easier to generate Sage Import files.

# Sage Import files

Look in the test code to see an example.  Sage line 50 has an import system that
allows you to import a certain number of transactions.  This is an alternative to
storing data in say the saved journal entries.

## Warning
This does not cope with foreign currency transactions.  Some of these will be accepted
but then you will have a mess.


### Installing a module locally
An aide memoire for me You need a command line like this:
'pip install git+file://C:/it/majorprojects/pySage50'
